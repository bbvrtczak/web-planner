# Web Planner

Project I am currently working on in free time. The idea is to create an interactive web planner to schedule things etc.

- Technology: Java Spring, PostgreSQL, React (Vite)
- Things done: communication with database, basic endpoints for getting tasks from database, simple UI showing list of tasks 
- Current stage: working on UI
