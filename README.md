# Web Planner

Project I am currently working on in free time. The idea is to create an interactive web planner to schedule things etc.

- Technology: Java Spring, PostgreSQL
- Things done: basic communication with database, some endpoints for testing purposes
- Current stage: picking front-end technology, probably will be React
